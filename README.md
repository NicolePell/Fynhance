## Hackathon Brief
Develop a digital idea to disrupt and transform the financial services industry for clients and staff.

The judging criteria was:
- Level of disruption
- Client time/cost saving
- Staff time/cost saving
- Ease of use
- Technical completeness

## Problem Statement
- A lack of oversight of individuals making investment decisions.
- Slow and bureaucratic processes for reviewing investment decisions.

## Goals and Purpose
Apply the benefits of pair programming to trading decisions to encourage better judgment, mentoring between juniors and seniors and reduce risk.

## Solution
- Management UI which lets a manager of a trading team allocate pairs and review decisions made.
- Pair Review Interface which lets pairs send trading tickets to each other and review them real time.

## Technologies
- Node.js
- Socket.IO
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery

## Collaborators

## Potential use cases
- Case 1. Experienced traders taking a large position. Peer input might serve as a check on non-optimal decisions.
- Case 2. Junior / Senior pairings. Junior traders can learn from their more experienced peers by receiving advice on their decisions, as well as having the chance to ask questions and provide input. This should be a two-way process.
- Case 3. Employee / Potential employee pairings. What better way is there to assess the ability of a potential employee than to pair with them on the tasks they would be performing?

## Future of this app
Where do we go from here? In the short term, we would expect PairTrade to supplement rather than replace existing review processes. In the long term, however, we would hope that the philosophy and functionality of PairTrade would help to move the financial industry out of the ego-driven wild-west era that has led to so many financial meltdowns and towards more sustainable review processes.
